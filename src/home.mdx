This site demonstrates some basic components that I use to put together websites. Components can be configured using props that are listed
in a table below each sample component. In lieu of specific properties, most components have certain defaults to match a style I've used previously on a site.

You can manually edit the code for each component to play around and see what happens.

It uses [styled-system](https://jxnblk.com/styled-system), [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [tachyons-system](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons-system) under the hood together with [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) (with a custom theme).
